<p class="about-description">Planning and learning are two crucial capabilities of robots. While planning seeks to solve a task by synthesizing policies on the fly, learning seeks to obtain solutions from experiences provided by data. The two domains have independently advanced in the past decades and both achieved remarkable success on their most suitable tasks. There is a noticeable trend to combine these two capabilities. Impressive success has been demonstrated by AlphaZero and MuZero, showing that the integration of planning and learning can advance human-level intelligence. Particularly, there are two complementary directions: learning to plan and planning to learn. From the perspective of planning, there are important attempts seeking to learn sampling distributions, action abstractions, heuristics, and representations for planning. From the perspective of learning, there are prominent efforts to enable active and uncertainty-aware learning, and to incorporate existing models to augment learning and achieve sample-efficiency. However, what is missing is a systematic discussion on where and how these two strategies shall be best applied and how they can be seamlessly integrated.</p>

<p class="about-description">In this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers in the planning and learning sub-domains, to discuss opportunities to integrate them — by planning to learn and learning to plan— and to incubate the next level of intelligence. Particularly, we will discuss what and how to learn for planning, what and how to plan for learning, as well as principled choices and combinations between these two. </p>

<p class="about-list-header">Some questions we would like to highlight:</p>
<ul class="about-list">
  <li class="about-item">Where should we best apply the two strategies: planning to learn and learning to plan?</li>
  <li class="about-item">What can we benefit from the integration of planning and learning, apart from the improved task performance and sample efficiency? particularly, safety, robustness, and explainability?</li>
  <li class="about-item">What factors in planning should be learned from data instead of being hand-crafted? And in the opposite, what factors in planning are most suitable to be defined by human experts instead of being learned?</li>
  <li class="about-item">When incorporating learned factors into planning, how do we maintain the original theoretical properties of planning, or what are the possible new criteria of defining guarantees for such integrated algorithms?</li>
  <li class="about-item">What are the new chances for using planning to help learning? And how do existing methods for planning to learn complement each other?</li>
  <li class="about-item">What are the chances to combine planning to learn and learning to plan, for instance, planning and learning in a closed-loop?</li>
</ul>
