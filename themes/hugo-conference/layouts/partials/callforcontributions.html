<p class="about-description">
We invite participants from all fields of robotics to submit extended abstracts related to the workshop topic, anywhere on the spectrum between model-based planning and model-free learning. Submissions should be up to 2-4 pages + references using the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/information/authorinfo/", target="_blank">RSS template</a> and should not be anonymized.</p>

<p class="about-description">Submissions can include original research, late-breaking results, position papers, and literature reviews. Significant overlap with work submitted to other venues is acceptable, as long as it has not yet been published or presented.</p>

<p class="about-description">Accepted submissions will be presented in 2-minute spotlight talks and in a dedicated poster session.  All accepted abstracts will be posted on the workshop website. The talks will be livestreamed and recorded. <p>
