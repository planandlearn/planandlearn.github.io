    - name: "Panpan Cai"
      photo: "/img/PanpanCai.png"
      bio: "Panpan CAI is a postdoctoral research fellow at the National University of Singapore, working with David Hsu on integrated planning and learning, planning under uncertainty, and their applications on autonomous driving in crowded environments. She received her Ph.D. with Cai Yiyu and Zheng Jianmin at Nanyang Technological University. Panpanâ€™s vision is to develop robots that can combine reasoning and learning to seamlessly interact with large-scale, dynamic, and interactive environments and accomplish challenging tasks."

    - name: "Peter Karkus"
      photo: "/img/PeterKarkus.png"
      bio: "Peter Karkus is a PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore advised by Prof. David Hsu. He has previously spent time at MIT as a visiting researcher and at Google and DeepMind as a research intern. Peter's vision is to build human-level robot intelligence by combining structure and reasoning with learning. Peter's recent works are on neural networks that encode differentiable robot algorithms in order to learn partially observable planning, visual navigation, mapping and localization tasks. His work has been recognized by a number of awards, including a Fulbright scholarship, NUS research achievement awards, and best paper nominations."
